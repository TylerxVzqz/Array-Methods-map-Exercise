# Array Methods (map) Exercise

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, you will practice an array method: **`filter`**. ðŸ¥³

You are provided with an array of users where each user has **`firstName`**, **`lastName`**, and **`points`**.

Your task is to iterate over this array using the **`map`** method and return a new array with new properties **`fullName`** and **`membershipStatus`**, where **`fullName`** is a combination of **`firstName`** and **`lastName`**, and **`membershipStatus`** is **`Premium`** if the user's points are more than 100, and **`Standard`** otherwise. Print the new array.
